# ProcessingGarden
Processing Garden is a processing script that when ran allows the user some 
basic functions to create a garden visual. It is up to the user to create the parts of plants they would like to be planted in their garden. They can plant flower stems, flower petals, tree trunks, tree leaves, and grass. Processing Garden gives the user all the tools they need to plant trees, flowers, and 
grass but engages them to create the where, what, and why on the canvas. Users can create different garden layouts and save their pictures to share with 
others. Users can feel proud of the different ways they utilized the building tools, and can be challenged to use them effectively in their creations instilling value. 

I am a big fan of gardening, however I am not particularly good at it in real
life. I saw this assignment as an opportunity to put gardening into a form that
I am a more comfortable with i.e. coding. To me, gardening really resonated
with the 'creative flow' aspect of the project. I feel that gardening is the perfect activity to send the user into a peacful and creative flow state. 

This project challenged me in a number of ways. First and foremost I found it
troubling to acclimate to a java modded language. Second, it took a while for 
me to plan out how I wanted the user to be able to interact with the garden. 
Luckily, professor Harmon made the intial brainstorming phase easy by 
recommending a digital garden. This was my first time creating an application
that had visual-based user feedback, and I enjoyed figuring out how to map
different garden implements to different keys on the keyboard. My thought 
process was challenged in that I wanted to make my system easy to use for the
user, so I didn't want to overwhelm them with features. I also used logical
keys on the keyboard for different functions such as 'trunk' is mapped to 't'
and 'stem' is mapped to 's'. Going forward I can appreciate the work behind
visually interactive systems with a better understanding and I can turn to the
wisdom I gained from thinking through making a user friendly system. 

There are no known bugs in the code.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
    - The blank brown canvas is your soil to begin planting.
    - In order to plant an object in a specific place, hover your cursor over 
    the desired area, then click the desired key on the keyboard.
    - Object & keyboard key pairings:
        's' --> flower stem
        'p' --> flower petal
        'g' --> a blade of grass
        't' --> tree trunk
        'l' --> one bunch of tree leaves

Happy Planting!
